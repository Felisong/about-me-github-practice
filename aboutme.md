# Hello! I am Carolina Henriquez Silva

## I am a creative girl, who has a love for computers. I also love my cats!

My old family cat, Sethy. He has sadly since passed.

This is my boyfriends cat, whom I have now taken in as my own. You've likely seen her if you're viewing this!

I just wanted to show you my loves.

I am 26 years old. I studied 2D character animation in the past, and really enjoyed it. Now I'm excited to be learning more things in web development!
