# Hello! I am Carolina Henriquez Silva

## I am a creative girl, who has a love for computers. I also love my cats!

I am 26 years old, and have always had a fascination for games, media, and art. I studied to be an animator for one year at VANARTS (Vancouver Institute of Media Arts). There I learned ToonBoom Harmony, an animation program and was able to work in the animation industry for six years, before changing my focus to studying Web Development.
In Web Development I hope to carry over my skills as a creative and finally link the logical part of me. I love problem solving and making things work efficiently, and can imagine myself really enjoying this profession.
