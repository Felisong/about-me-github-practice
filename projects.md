# My Projects

- [**Molly Of Denali**](https://pbskids.org/molly/)

  Key animator on Molly of Denali, I used ToonBoom Harmony and was here for a year. A key animator is someone who worries only about the primary poses that someone gets in, not the inbetween frames.

- [**Last Kids On Earth**](https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/80219119)

  General 2D animator on this show, I did a lot of slower animations for this. Think of something more similar to Disney style animation. ToonBoom Harmony was used for this.

- [**Dogs In Space**](https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/81017193)

  General 2D animator on this show. Probably one of my favorite shows to have worked on. I also used ToonBoom Harmony for this. I was a mid level animator in this show.

- [**Camp Snoopy**](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/camp-snoopy/umc.cmc.4erhnrmkf9vgeojl3uryxsc0j)

  General 2D animator on this show. Likely my most exciting project considering the big name. I was working on it with ToonBoom Harmony as well, as it is the industry standard program to use. I am familiar with many programs, and am quick to learn.
