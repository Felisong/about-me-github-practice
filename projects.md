# My Projects

- [**Molly Of Denali**](https://pbskids.org/molly/)

  Key animator on Molly of Denali, I used ToonBoom Harmony and was here for a year.

- [**Last Kids On Earth**](https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/80219119)

  General 2D animator on this show, I did a lot of slower animations for this.

- [**Dogs In Space**](https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/81017193)

  General 2D animator on this show. Probably one of my favorite shows to have worked on. I also used ToonBoom Harmony for this

- [**Camp Snoopy**](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/camp-snoopy/umc.cmc.4erhnrmkf9vgeojl3uryxsc0j)

  General 2D animator on this show. I hope to carry the skills I attained from this over to any future shows I may work on part time. I hope to aim to be a web developer from this point forward.
